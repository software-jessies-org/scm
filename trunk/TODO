* Show decent progress feedback and keep processing events while talking
  to CVS.

* Show CVS errors. (If we try to look at a non-existant file, say, there's
  no useful feedback at the moment.)

* Sort the revisions properly (cvs lists revisions with lots of dots in them
  out of order).

* Support the following styles of addressing on the command line:

   grep-style  "<filename>:<line>"
   vim-style   "<filename> +<line>"
   bk-style    "<filename> +@<line>" [check this]

* Use some kind of two-element selection model for the revisions list. Color
  the selected items so that if there's only one, it's red, and the second
  one is blue. (To correspond to the diff colors. The 'one item selected'
  case is less obviously right.)

* Use a JTextPane for the checkin comments, and allow some kind of filter
  to be specified by the user to rewrite references to bugs as links to
  bug database entries or whatever; be able to launch a browser when these
  are clicked on.

* Add search functionality. Usual C-D, C-F, C-G trio. I don't know how we
  can do Edit-like alpha highlighting, which is a shame.

* Add go to line functionality (not usually useful because you'd do it on the
  command line, or have your editor do it for you).

* Add C-A and C-C to the JList, so we can copy text out of it. (We can already
  copy checkin comments from the JTextArea.) Do we need an explicit patch
  export facility if we can just copy/paste?

* Show checkin comments for other revisions when you hover, so you don't
  *have* to look at another revision when you're looking at an annotated
  file to get some idea of whether you're interested in that revision.
  Here's an example of bonsai doing something similar:

* Auto-detect whether we're in a CVS or BitKeeper repository; for now, if
  we're in a BitKeeper repository, we can just invoke "bk revtool" and quit.

* Support a BitKeeper back-end as well as CVS. (If you don't do this sooner
  rather than later, you'll only make it more difficult!)

* Follow symlinks.

* For a given line, make it possible (and easy) to find out automatically
  when that line was removed.
