<div align="center"><h1>SCM</h1></div>

<h2>Don't GUIs for revision control systems suck?</h2>

<p>Yes. That's why I had to write the first good one. Most revision control
systems (CVS and
Subversion being prominent examples) don't come with a standard GUI. There
are a lot of third-party GUI tools, but they tend to be overly complicated
to use, not particularly keen to fit in with how you were already working,
only work with one revision control system, and don't offer anything over
the command-line tools.

<p>BitKeeper manages to come with GUI tools that are actually useful. Sadly,
they're limited to BitKeeper repositories, are somewhat idiosyncratic in
design, look disgusting, and are missing little niceties like spelling
checking for your comments.

<p>SCM, on the other hand, is useful, simple, portable (in two senses: I use
it on Linux and Mac OS, and I use it with BitKeeper, CVS and Subversion),
and pretty.

<P>Another important thing to realize is that SCM never asks for commitment
from you: it doesn't have any kind of set-up process (you can install it
anywhere you like), doesn't need to be taught about your repositories,
won't make any changes to your repositories other than the ones you ask
it to make when using CheckInTool, and it won't splatter junk all over
your file system. If you don't like it, just stop using it.

<h2>RevisionTool</h2>

<p>RevisionTool is used to examine a file's revision history. It replaces
<i>cvsweb</i> or <tt>bk revtool</tt>.

<p>I think a lot of people underestimate
the usefulness of a file's revision history; for me it's the main use of
a repository &mdash; I've never wanted to compile an old version of the
source, which seems to be a folk belief about why revision control is
useful. RevisionTool intends to make it easy to answer the interesting
questions about your source.

<p>Here's the annotated view. The list shows all the revisions of the
file. The text area shows the check-in comment from the selected revision
or revisions. The large scrollable area shows the file with the author and
revision information to the left. Lines in blue are from the selected revision,
and dotted horizontal rules separate adjacent lines from different revisions.
(You can double-click on a line to go to the same line in the revision in
which it was introduced.)

<p>Here's the patch view, which is what you see if you select more than one
revision in the list of revisions. (You can double-click on a line to go to
the appropriate line in the annotated view of the revision in which it was
introduced.)

<h2>CheckInTool</h2>

<p>CheckInTool is used to check in modifications. It replaces
<tt>cvs/svn commit</tt> or <tt>bk citool</tt>. Its main features
are that it lets you check in an arbitrary subset of your modified/new
files, it doesn't require a separate 'add' step, it checks spelling in
your check-in comment, and&nbsp;&ndash; this is the killer feature&nbsp;&ndash;
it shows you colored diffs of what you're about to commit. This is a great
way to avoid accidentally checking in stuff you didn't mean to.

<h2>I'm a BitKeeper user; what's in this for me?</h2>

<p>BitKeeper already has some pretty good tools. Here's where I think SCM
beats them:
<ul>
<li>More traditional (non-tk) interfaces. No purple or green in sight!
<li>More traditional copy &amp; paste. In particular, you can easily copy
comments to and from, and patches from RevisionTool.
<li>Looks and works great on Mac OS X.
<li>CheckInTool checks spelling in your check-in comments, and understands
CamelCase, making this feature more useful to programmers than it would
otherwise be.
<li>CheckInTool lets you comment newly-added files; <tt>citool</tt> adds
its own content-free comment to new files.
</ul>

<p>Of course, everything comes at a price. Here's where I think BitKeeper's
own tools beat SCM: 
<ul>
<li><tt>revtool</tt> understands BitKeeper's non-linear revisions; SCM
implicitly assumes a model more like Subversion's. It can be a lot harder
to follow forked histories in SCM, a decision made to make it easier to
navigate straight-line histories.
</ul>

<h2>How do I install it?</h2>

<p>Good question. The distribution is here (<a href="scm.tgz">scm.tgz</a>),
but you'll also need a copy of the library to go with it (<a href="../salma-hayek/salma-hayek.tgz">salma-hayek.tgz</a>).

<p>The <a href="ChangeLog">ChangeLog</a> is available separately.
