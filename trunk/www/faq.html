<h1>SCM FAQ</h1>

<!-- ---------------------------------------------------- -->

<h2>I've installed SCM. Now what?</h2>

<p>If you use <a href="/evergreen/">Evergreen</a>, SCM is automatically integrated into the SCM menu.

<p>Cygwin users should already have "checkintool" and "revisiontool" on their path, because our installer modifies their path.

<p>Linux users should already have "checkintool" and "revisiontool" on their path, because we install links in /usr/bin.

<p>Mac OS users will need to ensure that the Contents/Resources/scm/bin/ directory in SCM.app is on their path. You can use salma-hayek's "LSFindApplicationForInfo org.jessies.scm" to find the application at run time, but we have yet to write a relocatable script/binary to do this for you.

<p>Solaris users should already have "checkintool" and "revisiontool" on their path, because we install links in /usr/bin.
