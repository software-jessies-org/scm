* Shouldn't ignore the status code returned from cvs update/svn status/
  bk sfiles. Also need to cope better with the fact that "cvs update" is
  capable of producing a bunch of irrelevant output.

* We need a way to remove files. ("rm x; cvsvn rm x".) Ed points out that
  there's "cvs rm -f x", which doesn't require the file to have been removed
  from the local file system first. Do we really need anything here? Can we
  actually provide a better interface than just doing this on the command
  line? I'm not sure I can think of one.

* With BitKeeper, a pending change *will* be included in the next check-in.
  We need to have the 'included' boolean set to true, and non-editable.
  (Martin claims this isn't true with "bk citool", so there must be some
  way to work around it.)

* When we "cvs update" to find out what local changes we've got, we should
  (a) ignore successfully merged remote changes and (b) warn about merge
  conflicts.
  Not only conflicts; if you've pulled and are unaware, you probably want
  to quit and rebuild before committing.

* Should we force an "svn update"? Or does saving/restoring the comment
  field cover the remote-changes scenario well enough?

* The menu option to edit the selected file is okay, but what I really want
  is to be able to go straight to a patch hunk; even better, I'd like to be
  able to tell CheckInTool to revert a hunk (rather than a whole patch).
