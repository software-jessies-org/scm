* Shouldn't ignore the status code returned from cvs update/svn status/
  bk sfiles. Also need to cope better with the fact that "cvs update" is
  capable of producing a bunch of irrelevant output.

* We need a way to remove files. ("rm x; cvsvn rm x".) Or do we? Can we
  actually provide a better interface than just doing this on the command
  line? I'm not sure I can think of one.

* We need a way to revert files. ("svn revert x".)

* With BitKeeper, a pending change *will* be included in the next check-in.
  We need to have the 'included' boolean set to true, and non-editable.

* Save the comment field contents in repositoryRoot/.checkintool-comment in
  case you want to quit and come back.

* When we "cvs update" to find out what local changes we've got, we should
  (a) ignore successfully merged remote changes and (b) warn about merge
  conflicts.

* Should we force an "svn update"? Or does saving/restoring the comment
  field cover the remote-changes scenario well enough?
