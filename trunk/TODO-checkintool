* Shouldn't ignore the status code returned from cvs update/svn status/
  bk sfiles. Also need to cope better with the fact that "cvs update" is

* We need a way to remove files. ("rm x; cvsvn rm x".)

* We need a way to revert files. ("svn revert x".)

* We need a way to add new files. We should pass a List<FileStatus> to
  commit, rather than List<String>, and "cvsvn add" any file whose state
  is NEW.

* With BitKeeper, a pending change *will* be included in the next check-in.
  We need to have the 'included' boolean set to true, and non-editable.
